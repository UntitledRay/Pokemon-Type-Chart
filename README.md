# Pokemon-Type-Chart
This is an update of my original project: https://cssdeck.com/labs/typechartxy

My original project was a forked document based on the original code located at: http://cssdeck.com/labs/full/typechart

I found myself using the original page (based on Gen 5) quite a bit to visualize team strengths and weaknesses, and I wanted to update the chart to include the new changes within X and Y (Gen 6) at the time. I added the new Fairy type, all of the new Pokémon, updated Steel's dropped resistances of Dark and Ghost, and updated old Pokémon that are now considered to be Fairy-type, such as Clefairy and Togepi.

I've since lost my ability to access the account hosting the XY Typechart that I used to fork the original project (because the login page of CSSDeck is busted), so I figured moving it into a formalized github repository would make sense. This is not a commercialized project. All credit for the original code belongs to Tim Etler (https://github.com/etler). All updated code is my own.

Note: I'm not a programmer, so this is also functioning as a weird timeline of my own personal growth on this subject matter. I have a general understanding of how code works, or at the very least I can say that I know how to contextualize a data index to made changes and additions to it, so I have that going for me, which is nice. Obviously I was at one point able to update Tim's project to make the changes present in the XY Typchart, so this will serve as a record of my attempt to not only update that code once again to include more Pokemon, but also to see if I'm able to port it over to github, a platform I've never really used before in any significant capacity. To anyone who sees this:

I'm sorry.

I'm learning.

I'm absolutely open to feedback.

UPDATE - 11/15/2022
Fixed syntax on Pokemon like Farfetch'd with the apostraphe character in their name. Also updated files names and links in the HTML file.
