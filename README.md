# Pokemon-Type-Chart
This is an update of my original project: https://cssdeck.com/labs/typechartxy

My original project was a forked document based on the original code located at: http://cssdeck.com/labs/full/typechart

I found myself using the original page quite a bit to determine team strengths and weaknesses, and I wanted to update the chart to include of the new changes within X and Y at the time. I added the new Fairy type, all of the new Pokémon, updated Steel's dropped resistances of Dark and Ghost, and updated old Pokémon that are now considered to be Fairy-type, such as Clefairy and Togepi.

I've since lost my ability to access the account hosting the XY Typechart that I used to fork the original project, so I figured moving it into a formalized github repository would make sense. This is not a commercialized project. All credit for the original code belong to Tim Etler (https://github.com/etler). All updated code is my own.

UPDATE - 11/15/2022
Fixed syntax on Pokemon like Farfetch'd with the apostraphe character in their name. Also updated files names and links in the HTML file.
